# aboutme
I’m an ordinary web application developer. 

My strength is to solve problems cautiously while using first-principle thinking.When i’m interested in something, 
I study in depth to understand the fundamental’s first. I work at Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University at the moment. 
I’m looking for new experiences to use the English Language more to improve my speaking and comprehension. 
I hope that learning learning abroad will be helpful for self development.
